                <h2>About Simbotics</h2>
                <p>We are Simbotics, a FIRST Robotics Hall of Fame team from Governor Simcoe Secondary School in St. Catharines, and we’re excited to represent our team at the International Championship in Texas this year. Our team is dedicated to creating advanced robotics projects that challenge our technical and creative abilities, while building valuable skills in teamwork, leadership, and innovation. To accomplish this, we need your help! Competing at a high level comes with costs over $80,000 a year! We’re seeking support from businesses to help us represent our community on the world stage.</p>

                <h2>How can you support us?</h2>
                <p>We offer a variety of ways for you to support our team, and we strongly encourage you to reach out if you can contribute materials or machinery to assist our efforts at <a href="mailto:info@simbotics.org">info@simbotics.org</a>.

            <section class="section">
                <h2>Sponsorship vs Donation</h2>
                <p><strong>Sponsorships:</strong> By reviewing our sponsorship booklet, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of what partnering with Simbotics entails. We offer a tiered sponsorship structure, where higher levels of contribution result in greater visibility for your brand. This includes opportunities such as featuring your company’s name on our apparel or placing your logo on our robot. For this type of support, we will provide a Business Receipt, acknowledging that your contribution is in exchange for brand exposure.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Donations:</strong> If you wish to support our cause without the desire for brand visibility, donations can be made through the school board. In this case, you will receive a Charitable Receipt, which can be used for tax purposes. While your branding will not be featured, we deeply appreciate your generosity and support.</p>
